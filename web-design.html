        <strong>What Goes Into A Great Website?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot of planning and work! When designing a website, it should  be designed from your clients point of view. It needs to communicate the key information about your business in an easy to read, clear and effective way. It should answer questions like what services do you offer? How do they work? How will your clients benefit from using your services? And a whole lot more.
      </p>

      <p>
        You need to consider your client's experience on your website! Do they experience the website as slow, lacking information and ugly? Or is it fast, clear and responsive? Do all parts of your website work?
      </p>

      <p>
        How easy is it to find your website? This is where search engine optimization (SEO) comes into play. Choosing the right keywords to use on your website, so you are found in Google searches. There is also setting up the correct meta data that helps with getting your website found and when sharing through social media.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then there is the part about data usage that contributes to your websites bandwidth consumption. The higher it is, the more you pay! So are your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files properly compressed? What about your images? Have they been optimized? Do you take advantage of the tricks to speed up your website loading speed?
      </p>

      <p>
        And of course there is also the part of designing a modern and attractive website. This involves picking the right colours, layout of information, fonts, graphics/pictures and anything else that helps you convey information to your clients. The website also needs to work flawlessly on mobile phones and tablets. In today's high mobile usage market, this is a must!
      </p>

      <p>
        These are all things that we consider here at Alpkea when doing website designs.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
	      <strong>Benefits Of A New Website</strong>
	    </p>

      <p>
        Many people place a high importance level on a company's website. They do this primarily to decide if they will book, buy or use your services. If they don't like the looks of it, or they can't find what they are looking for quickly, they will leave! And you will lose their business. By having a fast, informative, nice and modern website, you gain trust from prospective clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you have certain manual tasks, or tools that you could create that would make your clients lives easier? Why not get it built! Automate repetitive tasks, save yourself time  and provide more value to your clients. Client's nowadays expect near instant answers, and if you are able to do that, this puts you firmly ahead of the competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        A well designed website that takes into account SEO, will not only help search engines profile your business better, but get you found. However, if you are looking to grow your business with paid advertising such as <a class="internal-links" href="https://alpkea.com/facebook-ads">Facebook Ads</a>, having a properly set up website is a must. Why? In order to convert website visitors into clients, they need to have a great experience. Poor experience equals no business. This is why having a proper website is crucial before branching out to advertising.
