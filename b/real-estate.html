    <div class="about">

      <p>
        I've lived in numerous properties over the years and have experienced both the highs and lows of buying and selling property. When things go, they just go. The whole process is smooth, the price is right, it's just what you want and the best part is it happens quickly. It is a pure sense of joy and happiness. It is simply great when things happen this way!
      </p>

      <p>
        But what about those times when things just don't seem to go? You keep searching and searching for that perfect property that just doesn't seem to exist. Or nobody seems interested in your property for the price that you want to sell it at. Or even worse is when the party has money problems. These things just bring frustration. Not only is it frustrating for the homeowners, but also for the realtors. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So why am I bringing this up?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well in the case of selling, I see it come down to 2 types of realtors. Those who act and those who don't.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>Defining Success</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        When prospective clients are in these undesirable situations, some choose to just sit back and blame something. Oh, it is the house. It's not big enough. It is too old. The location is bad. It is a slow month. The listing price is too high. It's a buyers market. And on and on. Everything and anything is used as an excuse to avoid putting the blame on their approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        What people like this don't understand is that you cannot use the same approach on everything and expect the same results time after time. Life, technology and the way we do things is constantly evolving. People evolve and adapt to things at different rates. Hence why you need to diversify your approaches and rely on many channels. As your chances of reaching the right person when using numerous channels greatly increases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now the other kinds of people are those who accept their initial strategy didn't work and work towards finding a solution. They realize that different properties require different attention and channels. They see that the key to getting the deal done is by using the right game plan. They don't just have one strategy and aren't afraid to use external assistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now what is external assistance?
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many channels that could be used, but I will focus on Facebook Messenger Marketing.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>New Opportunities</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the most simplest terms, Messenger Marketing can be thought of as a personalized, 1 on 1 conversation. Though it is all automated in nature and makes keeping in touch with thousands easy. It is a step up from email marketing, as it allows for interaction that can be built to have any number of conversational paths.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can be used for simple things such as promoting listings. Or for more complex and effective tasks such as finding, qualifying, segregating and nurturing prospective clients in an automated fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine checking your inbox to see a list of segregated prospective clients for you. Where you have all their contact information and know exactly what they want. Right down to the fine details. You simply pick and choose who to follow up with.
      </p>

      <p>
        If that isn't good enough, the messenger system can be built to message them a personalized list of properties that match their criteria. So when a prospective client sees a property that they are interested in, they will be sent to you. And the best part is this is all automated. You don't have to manually send information to all your prospective clients. You just let the system do its job.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what Alpkea specializes in. We will help you further diversify and add a successful new channel to your options.
