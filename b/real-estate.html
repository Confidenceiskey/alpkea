    <div class="about">

      <p>
        Having lived in numerous properties over the years, I’ve experienced first hand the highs and lows of buying and selling property. From the stress and frustration, to the joy and happiness. In an ideal world the whole process for the homebuyer would be top notch, seamless and convenient. This means that the property price is right, it’s exactly what they are after and it happens relatively quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then there are those times where the whole process is painful. The homebuyer experiences a slow service, and searching for a new home becomes time consuming. As a result, it leaves them with a negative opinion of the agency. In the end, it seems that the perfect property they are looking for just doesn’t seem to exist. On the flip side, homeowners get equally discouraged when nobody seems interested in purchasing their property, especially for the price that they want to sell it at. This all leads to dissatisfaction and frustration on everyone's part. It isn’t only frustrating for the homeowners, or homebuyers, but also for the realtors. Fortunately, there are great solutions available to help reduce such negative experiences.    
      </p>

      <p>
        In the case of selling, it comes down to two approaches -- Being passive or actively pursuing. 
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>Defining Success</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        When homeowners are in undesirable situations, some agents struggle with finding a solution because they are unaware or unwilling to change their methods. Instead of being on the lookout for new opportunities, they fall back on finding blame in the market for reasons such as high prices, wrong location or simply assuming it is a slow period. By not accepting that their approach to generating sales may need some revitalizing and not constantly seeking to improve their processes, they risk losing clients and income. They are passive.
      </p>

      <p>
        In business it's important to understand that you cannot use the same approach to everything and expect the same results time after time. Life, technology and the way we do things is constantly evolving. People evolve and adapt to things at different rates. Hence why you need to be evolving your strategies, but also relying on many channels. As your chances of reaching the right buyer (or seller), and at the right time, greatly increases when using numerous channels. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of falling behind by not having the right resources or mindset, you can work towards a mentality that many successful people have -- those who don't look for blame, accept that their strategy needs change and work towards finding a solution. These agents realize that different properties require different attention and channels. They see that the key to getting the deal done is by using the right game plan. They don't just have one strategy and aren't afraid to use external assistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now what is external assistance?
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many channels that could be used, but I will focus on Facebook Messenger Marketing.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>New Opportunities</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the most simplest terms, Messenger Marketing can be thought of as a personalized, 1 on 1 conversation. It interacts with your client similar to how you would -- however, it is automated in nature and makes keeping in touch with thousands easy. It is a step up from email marketing and allows for interaction that can be built to have any number of conversational paths.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can be used for simple things such as promoting listings or for more complex tasks like finding (when combined with Facebook Ads), qualifying, segregating and nurturing prospective clients in an automated fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine checking your inbox or CRM to see a new list of already segregated prospective clients for you. Having all their contact information and knowing exactly what they want. Right down to the fine details. Facebook Messenger Marketing does this for you automatically. You simply pick and choose how and when it's best to follow up. 
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also setup the messenger system to message clients a personalized list of properties that match their search criteria. So when a property catches the eye of a prospective client, they will be sent to you. Sometimes this process takes time before they are ready to buy and the best part is it's all automated. You don't have to manually remember or send information to specific clients. You just let the messenger system do its job.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what Alpkea specializes in. We will help you further diversify and add another successful lead generation stream to your existing channels.
