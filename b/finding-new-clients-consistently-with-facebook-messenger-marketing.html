    <div class="about">

      <p class="title">
        <strong>Meet John</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        John is a mountain guiding business owner. John loves climbing as much as being in the outdoors. For him, it was a natural decision to open up a professional guiding company.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the outside everything was great for John. He was doing what he loves and was getting paid for it.  He was providing great experiences to his clients and this made him happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, he hated having to deal with the daily customer inquiries and being stuck on the computer doing admin duties. But this was a crucial and necessary part of the business.
      </p>

      <p>
        John was also struggling to fill out his calendar during certain months. There tended to be a lot of variation in bookings and not as much consistency as John would have liked from month to month. This made money seem a bit scarce for John, in an already  competitive industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, John thought this was what all small business owners had to face and that there wasn't much he could do about it. He went about his business year after year. Working hard and simply hoping for a good year.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>Getting Ahead</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        One day John asked himself,  "how could he get a competitive edge?"
      </p>

      <p>
        John didn't have an answer to this and it bothered him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some weeks had gone by and he eventually forgot about this thought. But one day, a good friend of his invited him to come along to this small business networking event.
      </p>

      <p>
        John decided to go and met George. George introduced him to this new technology trend that many companies were jumping on and seeing great results. John was intrigued. Maybe this was the competitive edge he was seeking. Then he wondered if this could work in his industry.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went home that night and did some research. He found a company specializing in this area and reached out to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        After chatting with someone at the company, John felt that they really cared and understood his needs.  He felt that they would be able to help his business grow.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>John's Decision</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was a lot of money. Money that John didn't want to spend. John was on the fence about the offer he got. Should he take it? Or just continue along?
      </p>

      <p>
        John then remembered his competitive edge question. He thought, what is the worst that could happen? He ends up not being satisfied with the service and loses some money.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the flip side, he gets a more consistent calendar and doesn't have to worry about money as much. On top, he also gets a nice return on his investment while growing his business.
      </p>

      <p>
        John decides it is worth the risk and accepts the offer. He is happy and excited at the prospects of attracting new clients in a more reliable manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company starts by working with John to learn more about his business, clients, and main problems. The company finds out that John has trouble getting enough skiing clients at the start and end of the winter season.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>New Opportunity</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Together they decide to tackle this problem. The company will help attract and qualify prospective skiing clients for John, in an automated and more efficient manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        They spend several weeks together building out a plan for their first campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the campaign, John gets introduced to Ben. Ben ends up booking a skiing trip with John and becomes a client of his.
      </p>

      <p>
        How exactly did Ben meet John?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ben is John's ideal prospective client and really loves the outdoors. He is always on the look for adventures and one day when Ben is browsing Facebook, he comes across the campaign ad for guided skiing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He is intrigued, and clicks on the ad button to start a Facebook messenger conversation.
      </p>

      <p class="disclaimer italics">
        Usually an ad would only take Ben to John's website and that would be the end of it. The rest would be  up to John's website to convince Ben to inquiry/book a guided skiing trip. Ben would then need to send an email for more information, or request a booking. If he leaves John's website without sending an email, that prospective client is lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, Ben received a personalized greeting message from John's company through Facebook Messenger. This is the start of Facebook messenger marketing, and also the sales, process.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>New Success</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Ben responded to the Facebook message and a guided conversation began.
      </p>

      <p>
        It started by asking Ben some screening questions. It sparked his interest with pictures and video links. Provided Ben with more information he was seeking and finally showed him some suggested skiing trips.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was all done in a conversational and automated manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ben saw a trip that he was interested in and requested to find out more details. The messenger system then collected further information from Ben (name, contact details, trip duration, date &amp; price range …etc). Whatever John needed to know, all that information was gathered, put into a spreadsheet and emailed to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is how Ben was introduced to John and became one of his clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        By having the  Facebook Messenger Marketing process in place, it allows the system to screen out less serious prospective clients from the more serious ones. Allowing John to focus his energy on clients more likely to book.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, John also has access to all the people, like Ben, who messaged (and subscribed) to the messenger system. This allows  John the ability to send follow up messages and re-target interested prospective clients who didn't initially book. This is what makes messenger marketing campaigns so powerful!
