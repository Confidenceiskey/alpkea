      <h3 class="section-title">Why Did I Focus On The Mountain Guiding Industry?</h3>

    <div class="about">

      <p class="title">
        <strong>The Start</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        As a person who loves the outdoors, I felt it was something that I should be involved in. I always did outdoor activities throughout my life and it wasn't until I found a new passion in entrepreneurship that things changed for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the start of a new outlook on life. My dreams, ambitions and goals all changed. I started learning new skills that would help me succeed today. When I was finally ready to take action, I decided to focus on an industry. 
      </p>

      <p>
        But which one?
      </p>

      <p>
        Having a big interest in the outdoors, I realized that the mountain guiding industry would be a great fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        I dove in and spent lots of time learning more about them and  their problems. In my chats to numerous mountain guiding business owners, I discovered that I could help them solve some of their problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the very early works in creating what is now known as Alpkea. What are the main issues that mountain guiding business owners are facing?
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>Industry Challenges</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Global warming:</strong> I found this to be a big challenge for the mountain guiding industry as a whole. There businesses are completely dependent on mother nature. Mountain guiding owners cannot escape from the changing climate and must adapt to find the best working conditions. This can result in shorter snow seasons that have more unpredictable/variable conditions. Or simply having to adjust their scheduling and going to new destinations.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Competition:</strong> In countries like America, there happens to be a low barrier to entry. This creates stiff competition and keeps prices down. It can also lead to the commercialization of the industry through overusing the same routes, increasing group sizes, and simply offering a lower quality service. In addition, guides who do guiding work as a hobby tend to undercut prices.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Earnings:</strong> I've learned that many mountain guiding owners find it difficult to charge what they feel they deserve due to high competition. Most mountain guide owners would like to earn more, but hesitate to grow their business out of the fear of not earning enough money.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>Dislikes</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Mountain guiding owners do not like responding to e-mails, nor having to deal with an endless amount of questions. They don't like working with clients who have unrealistic expectations and who aren't flexible. They also don't like their earning potential as they feel their services are worth more.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>What Are They Afraid Of?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Mountain guides are afraid of the dangers that they face on the mountains. This could be anything from them, or even worse a client, getting injured. To more serious injuries or possibly even death. Personal safety is a big priority to them.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>Desires And Wants</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Mountain guiding owners want to charge a fair rate for their guiding services and currently feel that they have to lower their prices to stay competitive. They would like to have more golden clients who book well in advance, are highly flexible and want to go where the conditions are ideal. They would like much more of these types of clients year round. The last thing that  would make them happy  is to have more consistent bookings to fill out there schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="title">
        <strong>How Alpkea Can Help</strong>
      </p>

      <p>

Several had stood out to me and I went on a mission to tackle these issues. Namely that  mountain guiding business owners want to earn more, spend less time dealing with customer inquires, get more golden clients and have more consistent bookings.
